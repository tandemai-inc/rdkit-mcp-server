# RDKit MCP Server: Agentic Access to RDKit for LLMs

RDKit MCP Server is an open-source MCP server that enables language models to interact with RDKit through natural language. The goal is to provide agent-level access to every function in RDKit 2025.3.1 without writing any code.

## Features

* **Seamless Integration**: Exposes RDKit functions via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
* **Language Model Support**: Connect any LLM that supports the MCP protocol.
* **CLI Client**: Includes a command-line client powered by OpenAI for quick experimentation.

## Installation

Install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Start the Server

```bash
python run_server.py [--settings settings.yaml]
```

See `settings.example.yaml` for setting options

Once the server is running, any MCP-compliant LLM can connect. For example, see the [Claude Desktop quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

### CLI Client

A CLI client is included for rapid prototyping with OpenAI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-xxx"
python run_client.py
```

## Available Tools

List all available RDKit tools exposed by the server:

```bash
python list_tools.py [--settings settings.yaml]
```

## Evaluating with Promptfoo

We have provided examples configurations for using [Promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev/) to evaluate the quality of RDKit tool outputs and agent responses against various models. The `evals` directory contains example configs and test cases.

### Install Promptfoo

First, install Promptfoo globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g promptfoo
```

### Install RDKit mcp server
```bash
pip install .
```

### Run Evaluation

To run an evaluation using the config in the `evals` directory:

```bash
cd evals
promptfoo eval
```

This will execute the tests defined in `evals/promptfooconfig.yaml` and report the results. You can customize the config and add your own test cases as needed.

The test results can be viewed using
```bash
promptfoo view
```

For more details, see the [Promptfoo documentation](https://promptfoo.dev/docs/).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions, feature requests, and bug reports:

See `CONTRIB.md` for guidelines on how to get started.

Together, we can make RDKit accessible to a wider range of applications through natural language interfaces.
